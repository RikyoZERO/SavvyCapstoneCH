DEFINITION STATEMENT

I want to build a simple application that allows people to submit brief, anonymous secrets, confessions, or funny "duckUp" moments under the hashtag #iDuckedUp. Submissions will be stored in a database and displayed publicly on the site in real-time. This will create a lighthearted, judgment-free space where users can relate to each other’s mistakes. It will be an extension of my business partner & I's "Duckee" clothing brand. 

AUDIENCE

People looking for a fun, anonymous outlet to share personal stories without fear of judgment
Anyone who enjoys reading funny, awkward, or relatable moments
Social media users familiar with hashtags
Ages 16+ /due to mature humor potential/

PURPOSE
The purpose of my application is to give users a safe, anonymous, and humorous way to share their mistakes and awkward moments without fear of being identified or judged. It encourages honesty, humor, and shared experiences.
Problem Solved

People often want to share their embarrassing or funny mistakes but don’t have a safe, anonymous space to do so. Social media requires personal accounts and can lead to judgment. #iDuckedUp solves this by providing complete anonymity and an easy way to read or post confessions.
